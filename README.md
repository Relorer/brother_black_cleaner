My Brother printer prints an uneven black gradient. See the photo below.

This utility replaces pixels with a color intensity below a certain threshold (in my case, 2-3%) with lighter ones. This helps remove artifacts from photos.
I recommend using the desktop version of the program, as js (web version) slightly degrades the quality of the original photo.
